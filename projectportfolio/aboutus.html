		<h1>What is Venturous Voyage?</h1>
		<p><img src="parisbridge.jpg" width="250" height="178" alt=""/><span style="font-family: miller-display, 'serif;'; font-size: 25pt; font-style: italic;">Welcome to your home away from home.</span> Venturous Voyage started as your run of the mill travel and excursion company in 2013, but since then we've grown to be one of the biggest in the industry! As of 2023, we strive to provide our clients with quarterly trips to global tourist hotspots- one for each season. We know this sounds great, but what does this exactly mean for you?</p>
		
	  <p>Clients who wish to travel with a group of like-minded people who are excited to experience the world around them will book a quarter-long session ranging from $10,000 - $30,000. Simply choose your destination and season of travel, set up payment, and our team will set you up for the most amazing vacation you'll ever have! Guests may travel with a close group of friends, or may meet some new travelers who are also enjoying their Venturous Voyage. We provide our guests with around 3 months of luxury hotel stay, included daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals, and entertainment according to our pre-planned itinerary. Currently, Venturous Voyagers will be able to experience our Paris voyage, coming this summer. We hope to see you become a future Venturous Voyager!</p>
