				Since its founding in 1989, 3 Girls 1 Chef has been continuously dedicated to serving authentic Jamaican cuisine. Floyd Myers started his booming catering startup in the bustling climate of Buffalo, New York, but has  since then relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina where he continues to deliver delicious meals to Charlotte residents. All meals are made with locally sourced organic produce as well as spices internationally shipped from Jamaican vendors.
